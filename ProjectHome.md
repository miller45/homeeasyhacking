This project aims to document and collect code examples related to interfacing with Home Easy home automation hardware.  These devices communicate in short control codes over a 433Mhz interface.

Similar hardware is distributed under a number of different brand names :

  * Home Easy
  * Domia Lite
  * Klik aan Klik uit - Klik on Klik off
  * Byron
  * Bye Bye Standby

The overall aim is to allow the easy development of custom hardware / software that can interact with this hardware in more advanced ways than is possible with off the shelf components.
